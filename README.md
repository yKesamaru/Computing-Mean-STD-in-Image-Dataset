# Implementation 

The website is implemeted in Jekyll with help of [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages). The blog posts and website pages are coded in one of the three formats: `html` files,`ipynb` notebooks,  or `md` markdown pages. The notebooks and markdown posts are converted to `html` with GitHub actions, which allows publishing blog posts as Jupyter notebooks. The website includes the dark/light theme toggle, site-wide search, customly design menu pages and dynamic layout changes depending on the screen size. The repo contains all relevant files and codes required to deploy the website to GitHub pages and link it to a custom domain at https://kozodoi.me
